.Sh NAME
.Nm fspacectl
.Nd space management in a file
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libc
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In fcntl.h
.Ft int
.Fn fspacectl "int fd" "int cmd" "struct spacectl_range *range" "int flags"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a system call performing space management in the file referenced by
.Fa fd .
.Fa cmd
specifies the operation to take place in the file.
.Fa range
is the operation range.
.Fa flags
controls the behavior of the operation to take place.
.Pp
The
.Fa range
argument points to a structure defined as:
.Bd -literal
struct spacectl_range {
	off_t r_offset;
	off_t r_len;
};
.Ed
.Pp
The operation specified by the
.Fa cmd
argument may be one of:
.Bl -tag -width SPACECTL_DEALLOC
.It Dv SPACECTL_DEALLOC
Zero a region in the file specified by the
.Fa range
argument.
The
.Va "range->r_offset"
has to be a value greater than or equal to 0, and the
.Va "range->r_len"
has to be a value greater than 0.
.Pp
If the file system supports hole-punching,
file system space deallocation may be performed in the given region.
.El
.Pp
The
.Fa flags
argument needs to be the value 0 currently.
.Pp
The call does not return partial success if a signal is caught during execution.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
Upon successful completion, the value 0 is returned;
otherwise the value -1 is returned and
.Va errno
is set to indicate the error.
.Sh ERRORS
Possible failure conditions:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er EBADF
The
.Fa fd
argument is not a valid file descriptor.
.It Bq Er EBADF
The
.Fa fd
argument references a file that was opened without write permission.
.It Bq Er EINTR
A signal was caught during execution.
.It Bq Er EINVAL
If the operation is
.Dv SPACECTL_DEALLOC ,
either the
.Fa "range->r_offset"
argument was less than zero, or the
.Fa "range->r_len"
argument was less than or equal to zero,
.It Bq Er EINVAL
The operation is not supported by the file descriptor.
.It Bq Er EIO
An I/O error occurred while reading from or writing to a file system.
.It Bq Er EINTEGRITY
Corrupted data was detected while reading from the file system.
.It Bq Er ENODEV
The
.Fa fd
argument does not refer to a file that supports
.Nm .
.It Bq Er ENOSPC
There is insufficient free space remaining on the file system storage
media.
.It Bq Er ENOTCAPABLE
The file descriptor
.Fa fd
has insufficient rights.
.It Bq Er ESPIPE
